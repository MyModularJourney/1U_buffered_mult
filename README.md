# 1U_buffered_mult
1U version of my buffered multiple for eurorack.
Feel free to use it in whichever way you like.


Since this is a free DIY project, I'm not going to offer a whole lot of customer support. 
I've built all of them myself and can confirm that they're working as I intended.

Contact me on https://www.instagram.com/my_modular_journey/ if you have any questions.
